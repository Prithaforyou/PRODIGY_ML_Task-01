# 🏠 House Price Prediction Project

This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the **price of a house** based on:

- 📏 **Square Footage** (GrLivArea)
- 🛏 **Number of Bedrooms** (BedroomAbvGr)
- 🛁 **Number of Bathrooms** (FullBath)

The prediction is powered by a trained **Linear Regression model** using Python and scikit-learn.
